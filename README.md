# A Javascript application for unit and integration testing practice

The purpose of developing this application was to teach me how to write unit and integration tests for a JavaScript projects using Vitest.

Following along with Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy tutorial found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-unit-testing-the-practical-guide/)

# Max teaches:

**ARRANGE, ACT, ASSERT test layout**<br>
-Implement the AAA layout ensures that the code is defined clearly, well-written, and easy to understand<br><br>
**Tests should only test for one thing**<br>
-For example, testing for failure if incorrect parameters are passed, you can use multiple expect statements but your test should be made for an individual purpose<br><br>
**Testing ASYNC functions**<br>
Using the 'done' keyword for testing callback functions and expecting a test to 'reject' or 'resolve' for testing functions returning promises<br><br>
**Testing hooks (beforeAll, beforeEach, afterEach, afterAll)**<br>
-Useful for resetting global parameters before or after a test is called<br><br>
**MOCK and SPIES to ensure tests dont impact the application (e.g. files or databases)**<br>
-Using Mocks and Spies allows you to test your application functions without actually triggering the function (e.g. Http request or Database call). Can store your mock functions inside the __mock__ folder<br><br>
**Frontend DOM testing with happy-dom**<br>
-Using happy-dom which allows us to test our front-end code without actually having a website/DOM/GUI for us to test with

# A Javascript application for unit and integration testing practice

The purpose of developing this application was to teach me how to write unit and integration tests for a JavaScript projects using Vitest.

Following along with Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy tutorial found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-unit-testing-the-practical-guide/)

Max teaches:

-ARRANGE, ACT, ASSERT

-Tests should only test for one thing

-Tests should include a clear description

-Tests should implement clean code practices

-Testing for incorrect inputs and error handling

-Testing hooks (beforeAll, beforeEach, afterEach, afterAll)

=Testing ASYNC functions

-MOCK and SPIES to ensure tests dont impact the application (e.g. files or databases)

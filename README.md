# A Javascript application for unit and integration testing practice

The purpose of developing this application was to teach me how to write unit and integration tests for a JavaScript projects using Vitest.

Following along with Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy tutorial found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-unit-testing-the-practical-guide/)

# Max teaches:

-ARRANGE, ACT, ASSERT<br>
-Tests should only test for one thing<br>
-Tests should include a clear description<br>
-Tests should implement clean code practices<br>
-Testing for incorrect inputs and error handling<br>
-Testing hooks (beforeAll, beforeEach, afterEach, afterAll)<br>
=Testing ASYNC functions<br>
-MOCK and SPIES to ensure tests dont impact the application (e.g. files or databases)
